Code planning for Random Pronounceable Word Generator
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

function name
 takes:
 gives:

main:
 takes: input from user specifying approximate word length and language
  	style
 gives: list of words

consonant_cluster_list_jp
 takes: nothing
 gives: list of consonant clusters from Japanese along with a vector
	denoting whether each consonant cluster is allowed to be at the 
	beginning, middle, and/or end of a word

vowel_cluster_list_jp
 takes: nothing
 gives: list of vowel clusters from Japanese along with a vector
	denoting whether each vowel cluster is allowed to be at the 
	beginning, middle, and/or end of a word

forbidden_substrings_jp
 takes: nothing
 gives: list of substrings that do not exist in Japanese and a list of
	substrings to replace them

cluster_loader
 takes: desired word style
 gives: consonant_cluster_list, vowel_cluster_list, and forbidden substrings
	and replacements

word_builder
 takes: consonant cluster_list and vowel_cluster_list, desired word length
	as number of clusters
 gives: a list of strings (clusters) that together make up a word
 does:  randomly chooses whether to start with a consonant or vowel cluster
	randomly pulls an entry from the corresponding list, then it
	alternates between vowel and consontant clusters. before this point,
	it chooses whether to end with a vowel or consonant cluster. based
	on this it adds vowel and consant clusters until the word length is
	N-1 or N-2 (where N is the desired number of clusters) such that it
	ends with a vowel or consonant cluster.
 uses:  get_cluster, find_indices

get_cluster
 takes: cluster struct and 0-2 int describing whether the cluster should be
	in the beginning, middle, or end of the word, 3 lists of indices for
	clusters that can be in the beginning, middle, or end of a word
 gives: a single string

find_indices
 takes: vector array of integer flags and a vector of ints to to find the
	indices of
 gives: vector of row indices where searched for ints exist

word_checker
 takes: cluster list that makes up a word, list of forbidden substrings and
	replacements
 gives: same or modified version of cluster
 does:  for each forbidden substring, finds and replaces

generate_words
 takes: nothing, is a main function
 gives: list of words from a desired language
 does:  reads a text file for clusters and calls word_builder multiple times
 uses:  world_builder, file_reader

file_reader
 takes: name of file containing list of vowel or consonant clusters
 gives: ClusterInfo struct
 does:  reads lines of text file and parses cluster content and metadata
 uses:  string_splitter
